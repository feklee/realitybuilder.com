* placeholder.vf: Sony Vegas project file for rendering a placeholder video,
  that may be loaded at the beginning.


How video clips were created
============================

1. Vegas Movie Studio 9.0 (could have also used Vegas Pro 9.0):

  a) Set up a project with a size of 1024x720 square pixels. Note that in the
    Reality Builder only 690 vertical pixels will be visible: The top 15 and
    the bottom 15 pixels will be cut off.

  b) Placed markers named "start"/"end" at the latest start and earliest end of
    actions. The latest start and earliest end is defined to be when a part of
    me or the block that I'm carying gets visible in the scene. A shadow
    doesn't count as part.

    Result: Step 1.vf

2. Vegas Pro 9.0:

  a) Converted markers to regions, using scripting:

    Markers to Regions.js

  b) Named regions with the index of the respective configuration transition.
    Added/removed some regions where markers had not been correctly set
    earlier.

    Result: Step 2.veg

  c) Padded regions, using scripting:

    Pad Regions.js

    Result: Step 3.veg

3. Batch rendered, using scripting:

    Batch Render Clips.cs

4. Uploaded to YouTube, from Windows XP command prompt:

    Upload.bat

5. Went through the log and looked for files where no video URL was listed. For
  these files upload failed. I reuploaded them and added the new URLs to the
  log.

6. On YouTube:

  - Verified that the number of videos is correct.

  - Changed privacy to: Unlisted

  - Changed license to: Creative Commons (CC-BY)


Video rendering settings for Sony Vegas Pro 9.0
===============================================

Notes:

* Audio has to be on, to avoid issue with gray video beginning:

  http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/youtube/thread?tid=782af5e328201258

* Using a bitrate as low as 1.000.000 doesn't result in much smaller videos on
  YouTube, as tested with Chrome YouTube Downloader. YouTube currently seems to
  encode at a bitrate between 1 and 2 Mbps.

How still images were created
=============================

1. Vegas Pro 9.0:
